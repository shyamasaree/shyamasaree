Choosing the right saree can transform your entire look. With 15+ years of experience in the saree industry, we've helped thousands of women find their perfect match. Here's our expert guide.

## For Petite Body Types

If you're petite (under 5'3"), lighter fabrics and smaller prints work best:

- **Choose:** Cotton, Georgette, Chiffon
- **Avoid:** Heavy Banarasi silks with large borders
- **Pro Tip:** Vertical prints create an illusion of height
- **Best Colors:** Light pastels, monochromatic looks

## For Tall & Slim Body Types

You can carry almost any saree style beautifully:

- **Choose:** Heavy Kanjivaram silks, bold prints, wide borders
- **Avoid:** Too lightweight fabrics that don't drape well
- **Pro Tip:** Experiment with contrast blouses and statement jewelry
- **Best Colors:** Rich jewel tones, vibrant colors

## For Curvy Body Types

The right draping style makes all the difference:

- **Choose:** Medium-weight fabrics like Tussar, Chanderi, Soft Silk
- **Avoid:** Stiff fabrics that add bulk
- **Pro Tip:** Dark colors with vertical patterns are slimming
- **Best Colors:** Deep maroons, navy, emerald green

## Universal Saree Selection Tips

1. **Fabric Matters:** Cotton for daily wear, Silk for special occasions
2. **Season Awareness:** Light fabrics for summer, heavier ones for winter

# Complete Saree Care Guide: How to Store and Maintain Your Precious Sarees

With 15+ years in the saree business, we've learned exactly how to preserve these beautiful garments. Follow our professional care guide.

## Storage Guidelines by Fabric Type

### Silk Sarees (Banarasi, Kanjivaram, etc.)

**Storage Method:**
1. Wrap in unbleached muslin or cotton cloth
2. NEVER use plastic - silk needs to breathe
3. Add neem leaves or silica gel packets to prevent moisture
4. Store flat in a cool, dry place

**Frequency:** Refold along different lines every 3 months to prevent permanent creases

**Temperature:** Below 25°C with low humidity

### Cotton Sarees

**Storage Method:**
1. Can be stored in breathable cotton bags
2. Starch lightly before storing for crisp drape
3. Camphor or neem leaves to prevent insects

**Frequency:** Refold every 4-6 months

**Temperature:** Room temperature is fine

### Georgette/Chiffon Sarees

**Storage Method:**
1. Hang on padded hangers for designer/embellished pieces
2. Lighter pieces can be folded with acid-free tissue paper
3. Keep in garment bags

**Frequency:** Minimal refolding needed if hanging

**Temperature:** Cool, dry place away from direct sunlight

### Embellished/Designer Sarees

**Storage Method:**
1. Wrap each in acid-free tissue paper
2. Store flat to prevent embellishment damage
3. Individual storage to avoid color transfer

**Frequency:** Handle with care, refold every 6 months

**Special Care:** Heavy embellishments should always be stored flat

## Cleaning Guidelines

### When to Dry Clean

**Always Dry Clean:**
- Silk sarees (Banarasi, Kanjivaram, Tussar)
- Heavily embellished sarees
- Sarees with zari work
- Designer sarees with delicate work
- Any saree with "Dry Clean Only" tag

**Important:** Choose a dry cleaner who specializes in ethnic wear

### When to Hand Wash

**Safe to Hand Wash:**
- Pure cotton sarees (without embellishments)
- Linen sarees
- Daily wear georgette (check label)

**Hand Washing Steps:**
1. Fill basin with cold water
2. Add mild detergent (baby shampoo works great for delicate fabrics)
3. Soak for 15-20 minutes (NOT longer)
4. Gently swish, don't scrub
5. Rinse with cold water until water runs clear
6. Roll in towel to remove excess water (don't wring!)
7. Dry in shade, never direct sunlight

### Stain Removal

**For Fresh Stains:**
1. Blot immediately, don't rub
2. Use cold water for most stains
3. For oil stains: Sprinkle talcum powder, let sit, brush off
4. For makeup: Mild dish soap on cotton swab
5. **When in doubt:** Take to professional cleaner

**Never:**
- Use bleach on any saree
- Apply hot water to silk
- Rub vigorously on delicate fabrics

## Common Saree Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Yellow Stains on Old Silk Sarees

**Solution:**
- Mix 1 part glycerin + 1 part water
- Apply to stains, let sit 30 mins
- Dry clean
- For severe cases: Professional restoration only

### Problem 2: Musty Smell

**Solution:**
- Air out in indirect sunlight for 2 hours

- Use activated charcoal bags in storage

### Problem 3: Creases Won't Come Out

**Solution:**
- For cotton: Spray with water + starch, iron on medium heat
- For silk: Steam iron on lowest setting with cloth in between
- For delicate fabrics: Professional steaming

### Problem 4: Color Bleeding/Transfer

**Prevention:**
- Store dark and light sarees separately
- Use acid-free tissue paper between folds
- Never store wet or damp sarees

### Problem 5: Zari Tarnishing

**Solution:**
- Pure gold/silver zari: Gentle dry cleaning
- Imitation zari: Avoid water, spot clean only
- Polish carefully with soft dry cloth

## Seasonal Maintenance Calendar

### Every 3 Months:
- [ ] Refold all silk sarees
- [ ] Check for insects or moisture damage
- [ ] Replace neem leaves/silica gel
- [ ] Air out in indirect sunlight

### Every 6 Months:
- [ ] Organize and categorize collection
- [ ] Dry clean special occasion sarees (even if unworn)
- [ ] Check blouse sizes and condition
- [ ] Repair minor damages

### Yearly:
- [ ] Professional moth treatment if needed
- [ ] Deep clean storage areas

- [ ] Consider climate-controlled storage for heirlooms

## Emergency Saree Care Kit

Keep these items handy:
1. Safety pins (various sizes)
2. Needle and thread (matching colors)
3. Stain remover wipes
4. Small scissors
5. Double-sided fabric tape
6. Portable steamer
7. Lint roller

## Professional Tips from 15+ Years Experience

1. **Never store sarees in attics or basements** - temperature fluctuations damage fabric
2. **Invest in good storage** - it's cheaper than replacing damaged sarees
3. **Keep purchase receipts** - especially for expensive pieces
4. **Photograph your collection** - helps with insurance and cataloging
5. **Rotate your collection** - don't let sarees sit unworn for years

## When to Seek Professional Help

Contact a textile restoration expert if:
- Saree is a family heirloom
- Heavy zari tarnishing on valuable piece
- Severe discoloration or damage
- Fabric is very delicate or old
- You're unsure about any cleaning process
